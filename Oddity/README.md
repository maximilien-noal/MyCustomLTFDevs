This project runs O.D.T, and uses Windows Multimedia API (WinMM.dll) to play music files when levels are being loaded.

It also plays video files, but this part can be removed - turns out the game already does it even with the half-working NOCD I made.

I say half-working because there is no need for the CD anymore. But the game still detects that there is no cd and decides that there is no need to play the CD music.

Which this program (that runs as long the game is running) tries to fix.
